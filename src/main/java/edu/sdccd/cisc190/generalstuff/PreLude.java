/**
 * The PreLude class represents the introductory scene of the game "NightShift at Seven Guys".
 * It initializes the game interface that introduces the player to their new office environment
 * and displays their current conviction and madness statistics.
 *
 * <p>This class sets up the user interface elements, including the game status text, player stats,
 * and an action button that leads to the next scene once clicked. The action button transitions
 * the player to the {@link TwelveMorning} scene.</p>
 *
 * <p>Usage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * Stage primaryStage = new Stage();
 * PreLude preludeScene = new PreLude(primaryStage, conviction, madness);
 * primaryStage.setScene(preludeScene.getScene());
 * primaryStage.show();
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see TwelveMorning
