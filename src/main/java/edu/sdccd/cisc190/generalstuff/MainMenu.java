/**
 * The MainMenu class represents the main menu scene of the game "NightShift at Seven Guys".
 * This class sets up the user interface for the initial interaction with the player, allowing
 * them to either unlock the door, which increases their conviction and madness stats, or exit
 * the game entirely.
 *
 * <p>The MainMenu includes buttons for the player to make choices, a description of the game
 * context, and displays the current conviction and madness statistics.</p>
 *
 * <p>Upon clicking the "Unlock the door" button, the game transitions to the PreLude scene,
 * passing along the updated conviction and madness values.</p>
 *
 * <p>Usage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * Stage primaryStage = new Stage();
 * MainMenu mainMenu = new MainMenu(primaryStage);
 * primaryStage.setScene(mainMenu.getScene());
 * primaryStage.show();
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see PreLude
